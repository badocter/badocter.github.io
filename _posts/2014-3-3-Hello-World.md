Just getting arround to setting up github pages related to my account, so I used the following template at  [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to set up my pages repository (badocter.github.io) and this blog.  Not entirely sure yet if or how I will used this blog as I am still learning what features the pages have.
